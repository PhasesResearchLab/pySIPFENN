### pySIPFENN MGF-PSU Workshop (Feb 2023)

This Jupyter notebook is a brief walkthrough covering core functionalities of 
the **pySIPFENN** or **py**(**S**tructure-**I**nformed **P**rediction of 
**F**ormation **E**nergy using **N**eural **N**etworks) package; available 
through the PyPI repository. It covers:

1. Installation
2. Setup and Run on Directory with Structure Files
3. (advanced) Calculating the Formation Energy of all 243 End-Members of 
   5-Sublattice Sigma Phase (TCP) Ternary System
4. Combining Results from Different Models
5. (advanced) Adding a Custom Model
