**News:**

-  **(v0.11.0)** Some common questions are now addressed in the
   `documentation FAQ
   section <https://pysipfenn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html>`__.
-  **(v0.11.0)** The model downloads from Zenodo are now multithreaded
   and are 15 times faster.
-  **(March 2023 Workshop)** We would like to thank all of our amazing
   attendees for making our workshop, co-orgazined with the `Materials
   Genome Foundation <https://materialsgenomefoundation.org>`__, such a
   success! Over 100 of you simultaneously followed all exercises and,
   at the peak, we loaded over 1,200GB of models into the HPCâ€™s RAM. At
   this point, we would also like to acknowledge the generous support
   from `IBM <https://www.ibm.com>`__ who funded the workshop. Please
   stay tuned for next workshops planned online and in-person at
   conferences. They will be announced both here and at the `Materials
   Genome Foundation <https://materialsgenomefoundation.org>`__ website.
